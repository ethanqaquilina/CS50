Q1. if songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

A1. I would say they like hip-hop songs and pop

Q2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

A2. I think it doesn't account for genre of the music. Although we have energy, danceability, and valence, its hard to define genres this way or styles.
